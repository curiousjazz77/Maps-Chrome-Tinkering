# Using PostgreSQL for data analysis & visualization

General Information

1. Columnar (Redshift, BigQuery) vs Row-based (MySQL, PostgreSQL) DBs:
    - https://www.flydata.com/blog/whats-unique-about-a-columnar-database/
    
2. Data types:
    - `Some examples of geometry subtypes are POINTZ, POINT, LINESTRING, LINESTRINGM, POLYGON, POLYGONZ, POLYHERALSURFACE, POLYHEDRALSURFACEZ, TIN, and TINZ. A typical type declaration in PostGIS is geometry(POINT,4326), where geometry is the data type, POINT is the subtype type modifier, and 4326 is the SRID type modifier.`
    - Point: Subtypes of points differentiate themselves by the dimension of the Cartesian space they occupy.
    - Linestrings: Connected straight lines between two or more distinct points form linestrings. Individual lines between points are called segments. Segments arenâ€™t data types or subtypes in PostGIS, but it is possible for a linestring to have just one segment.
    - Polygons: Closed linestrings are the building blocks of polygons.
